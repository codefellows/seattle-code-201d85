# CSS for Images, Color, Text & Git Branching

## Overview

In this class you will be closing out on the "About Me" quiz project. You will have two other lab assignments due that will help you with CSS and learning a new git workflow using branches.

## Class Outline

- Code Review of previous day's lab assignment
- Code Demo
  - Images in HTML
  - Function review
- Lab preview and prep

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to

#### Describe and Define

- Image formats (JPG, GIF, PNG) and the strengths/weaknesses of each format.
- The importance of GitHub and branches.

#### Execute

- Publish a static webpage on GitHub page from a specific branch.
- Apply the use of images, color, and text formatting to style an HTML page.
- Git repository management through the use of branches and merging.

## Code demo for lab

The lab for this class is a 'one-off' lab, in that it is not directly connected to your "About Me" project.

You'll be working individually. The GitHub workflow today is different, too, and is designed to give you a lot of practice working with branches, which is the last major piece of Git for us to cover. We need to spend a bit of time with it, and get practice with it, so that you understand what you are doing.

The concepts covered in this lab assignment (functions that receive input and return output) will be VERY VERY helpful for you in our next big project. Ideally you will continue to work on little problems like this for additional practice.
