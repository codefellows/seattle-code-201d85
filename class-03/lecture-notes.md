## Arrays

- Data type // Data structure - **special type of object**
- A collection of data/elements or a list of data/elements
  - Can be mixed... strings, numbers, booleans, arrays...
- In JS we don't have predetermine the size of our array
- Every element in the array has an index(location reference) for where we can find the element
  - JS arrays are a zero based index

- Built in methods!
  - `.pop()`  - remove the last element from the array
  - `.push()` - add any number of elements to the end of the array

- Property
  - `.length` - this will tell me how long array is

## Loops

### For Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - Great for doing something a certain number of times
  - Great for iterating or looping through arrays!

```javascript
for(starting value; condition; increment){
  do something for a finite number of times
}
```

### While Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - While loops do something until the condition is false
  - Beware of infinite loops!

```javascript
while(condition){
  do soemthing until the condition is false
}
```
