      // this is a javascript comment
      // just like html, the browser will "ignore" this

      // this is a browser specific function called an alert
      // it is used as a simple way to "alert" the user of something
      // while not employed much in practice today, it is still a useful tool for errors and developer debugging
      alert('hello world!');
