# Week 6 Project:  Mockup to Markup with Version Control

It's time for your first "from the ground up" software development project!

You will be working with a group of 2 - 3 of your peers this week.  Your instructor will assign your teams.

It's the job of your team to conceptualize, design, and implement the HTML markup for a website of your choice.  After completing each of the following modules: CSS & JavaScript (both which will take about 8 weeks), you will get another week of projects to add in that layer.  By the time you finish this course, you will have a fully featured, clean, polished, collaboratively built, and professional website that you can share with the world!

## Requirements
- Discuss with your team what the domain of your website is.
- With your team, create a wireframe for each page of your website.  Each page should contain the same basic `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` structure - the `<main>` content area is where each page will have it's own content.  Be sure to link between your pages in your navigation.
- Create a single GitHub repository.  Add all other project team members this repository as collaborators.
- If you are comfortable with it, create Git branches for each page.  This will require you to step outside of your comfort zone but will also give you and your team the ability to work independently from each other.  Otherwise, all project work should happen collectively, through discussion, where one team member writes the code and the others discuss.  You will need to swap roles on this so that each person gets to code.  
- Create a document (MS Word or Google Docs is fine) to manage who is building what.
- Work with your team throughout the week to build the final HTML content for your website.  You will not be allowed to modify much of your HTML code when we get to the CSS portion of this project - make smart decisions with your markup!

**Note:**  There is a daily individual retrospective assignment that you must fill out before the end of the day.  This is the place for you to log your thoughts about the project.  If things are going well, talk about it!  If things aren't, talk about that too!  It's important for both management and yourself to reflect on what was built each day.  This is your first step into that process.
