# Group Project: Team Agreement

You will be required to make a Team agreement today with your partner. This will be used as the baseline and structure requirements for how you will complete Salmon Cookies (and future projects).

Review and write out your plan for the following. Be sure to label each section explicitly. This is for you and your partner to break the ice and understand your professional work competencies and boundaries.

**Communication plan:** How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

**Conflict plan:** What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?

**Work plan:** How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

**Git process:** What is your Git flow?

**Any thing else you feel is important:** expectations around work times, stand-up times (outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
