# Code 201: Foundations of Software Development - High School Edition

Welcome to the Code 201 - High School Edition Facilitator Guide.

## Overview

Build a strong software development foundation and learn how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various libraries to create fully-functional web apps.

This course guides students toward developing a well-rounded foundation of skills necessary for modern web development. These skills include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding; utilizing Git workflow processes, project organization, designing with wireframing and employing introductory Agile development methods.

## Outcomes

- Define the structure of a web page utilizing the semantic hierarchical structural conventions of HTML5.
- Apply CSS and HTML to implement page layout styles including grid, fluid, and responsive techniques; and to style content with color, typography, and images.
- Utilize Javascript to make web projects interactive, such that user input is stored and processed to create updated and personalized content when a user interacts with a page.
- Write JavaScript that leverages the fundamentals of Computer Science, the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm, basic data types, data structures, and basic algorithms, so that the code is efficient, error-free, and matches commonly accepted standards and practices of syntax and style, as measured by the codeâ€™s functionality and ability to pass a code linter.
- Utilize industry-standard version control tools and workflows, including Git and GitHub, to write functional, properly styled code and to work efficiently and harmoniously in professional environments.
- Be prepared for a Code 301 course.

## Prerequisites

- Required: Familiarity with basic algebra concepts.
- Code 101: Explore Software Development: If you are completely new to coding, complete Code 101 to build your first website using HTML and CSS and to find out if a career in software development is right for you.
- Code 102: Intro to Software Development: Prepare for the Code 201 deep-dive with instructor-led labs introducing you to the professional tools of the trade. Practice more with HTML & CSS, and learn basic JavaScript as you continue to discover version control systems to backup and store your code.

## Stacked Modules

Concepts in each of our courses are taught using stacked modules, where a new concept is introduced in each class session, building upon what came before it. This is a challenging style that requires persistence, practice, and collaboration, but allows more concepts to be introduced over the length of the course.  This will help students understand concepts deeper over the course of the year.
