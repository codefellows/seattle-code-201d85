# Prework for Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

Welcome to Code 201! 

As this course nears its start date, and you complete your enrollment, you will be invited to Canvas, our online Learning Management System. There you will be able to confirm your prework is complete, and submit the corresponding assignment as required.

Start on this prework as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself adequate time to complete it. If you have tested in to this class, you'll likely need a few dedicated hours to complete the computer setup, which is essential to a smooth start to class. 

Note: All prework is due before the start of the first class.

### For Those Who Have Not Completed Code 102

These assignments are helpful for those who have not completed Code 102 but are still helpful if you have taken Code 102 and would like some review.

- Brush up on Algebra *(1-2 hours)*
  - [http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/index.html](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/index.html){:target="_blank"}
  - You don't need to read through each topic, but you should have familiarity with most of them.
  - These kinds of logical and mathematical concepts will be very useful to you as you dig into writing code.
- Practice the Terminal *(1-2 hours)*
  - [https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial){:target="_blank"}
  - Please work through Sections 1 through 5 of this tutorial. Note: This tutorial is for everyone, even though the word "Linux" is in the title! The same commands work in Windows and MacOS terminals as well.
- Git tutorials *(1-2 hours)*
  - [https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide){:target="_blank"}
    - There is a lot of useful information in the Udemy tutorial, but it is a lot to digest for beginners. Skim through it as you can while striving to acquire terminology and gaining an understanding of the large concepts. Learning about version control is one of the most challenging things in the first week of Code 201. Above all, for now, strive for a conceptual understanding of how version control works, and why we use it in software development. The details are much more easy to grasp once the concepts are in place.
