# Project Week: Milestone 4

## Presentation Prep

1. Test your presentation:

* As you now have MVP in place and are focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goals today, take a few minutes at some point to take a look at your app on a projector/screen setup. You'll be glad you did. It's often a moment of, "THAT'S not what we want it to look like!" We'll strive to have the instructor/TAs do this with each team the day before presentations.

1. Plan your presentation... have a script:

* Who will give an intro, and tell us about the problem domain and your team's solution? In other words, MC?
* Who will talk about the functionality, and walk us through the app?
* Who will show us the code when you are showing off a technical challenge you overcame?
* Individually, speak around 3 minutes on the challenges that arose during project week, how your team overcame them, how you contributed to the solution, and what you learned, what you enjoyed working on, etc.

1. Rehearse your presentation:

* Decide whose machine will present the app on the projector, test it, and then test a second computerâ€¦ just in case.
* Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics. Know how much time each segment will take.

1. Overall presentation script (a suggestion, not required):

* 5 minutes - Intro/demo
* 3 minutes - Technical challenge in the code
* 3 minutes per person (12 minutes total, more or less)
* Q&A
